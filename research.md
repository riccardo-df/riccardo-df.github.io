Abstract: 
Researchers and policy makers are often interested in uncovering the heterogeneous effects of particular policies or "treatments." Generally, this is achieved by reporting average treatment effects in different subgroups formed by observable covariates. However, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty about the appropriate grouping. This paper proposes a nonparametric approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. The approach constructs a sequence of groupings, one for each level of granularity. Groupings are nested and feature an optimality property. An "honesty" condition allows us to construct valid confidence intervals for the average treatment effect of each group. The use of the proposed methodology is illustrated through an empirical exercise that revisits the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight.
