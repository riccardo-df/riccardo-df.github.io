> <sub> *Uncovering the heterogeneous effects of particular policies or "treatments" is a key concern for researchers and policymakers. A common approach is to report average treatment effects in different subgroups based on observable covariates. However, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty about the appropriate grouping. This paper proposes a nonparametric approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. The approach constructs a sequence of groupings, one for each level of granularity. Groupings are nested and feature an optimality property. An "honesty" condition allows us to construct valid confidence intervals for the average treatment effect of each group. The use of the proposed methodology is illustrated through an empirical exercise that revisits the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight.* </sub>

## Work in Progress

> <sub> *Empirical studies in various social sciences often involve categorical outcomes with inherent ordering, such as self-evaluations of subjective well-being and self-assessments in health domains. While ordered choice models, such as the ordered logit and ordered probit, are popular tools for analyzing these outcomes, they may impose restrictive parametric and distributional assumptions. This paper introduces a novel estimator, the ordered correlation forest, that can naturally handle non-linearities in the data and does not assume a specific error term distribution. The proposed estimator modifies a standard random forest splitting criterion to build a collection of forests, each estimating the conditional probability of a single class. Under an "honesty" condition, predictions are consistent and asymptotically normal. The weights induced by each forest are used to obtain standard errors for the predicted probabilities and the covariates' marginal effects. Evidence from synthetic data shows that the proposed estimator features a superior prediction performance than alternative forest-based estimators and demonstrates its ability to construct valid confidence intervals for the covariates' marginal effects.*
    
- <b>**The Cost of Coming Out** (joint with [Enzo Brox](https://sites.google.com/view/ebrox)).</b>
[*Draft available on request*]

> <sub> *Despite significant progress in advancing lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) rights, discrimination based on sexual orientation remains a prevalent issue in many countries. The concealable nature of sexual orientation presents LGB individuals with a trade-off: to avoid discrimination, they may choose to hide their identity, but this decision often results in negative mental health outcomes. Consequently, understanding people's reactions to the disclosure of sexual minority status is crucial. In this paper, we use an innovative source of data from a famous online video game to credibly identify the effects of coming out. At the beginning of the 2022 LGBT Pride Month, the developers of the game announced that one of their playable characters is gay. We use detailed daily data to track playersâ€™ revealed preferences for the character over time and employ synthetic control methods to isolate the effect of the disclosure. Our findings suggest a substantial and persistent negative effect of coming out.* </sub>
