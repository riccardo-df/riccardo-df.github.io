## Working Papers
Di Francesco, R. (2022).
<b>**Aggregation Trees.**</b> <i>CEIS Research Paper, 546.</i>
[<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304256">paper</a>]
[<a href="https://riccardo-df.github.io/aggTrees/index.html">R package</a>]

><sub> *Researchers and policy makers are often interested in uncovering the heterogeneous effects of particular policies or "treatments." Generally, this is achieved >by reporting average treatment effects in different subgroups formed by observable covariates. However, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty about the >appropriate grouping. This paper proposes a nonparametric approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. The approach >constructs a sequence of groupings, one for each level of granularity. Groupings are nested and feature an optimality property. An "honesty" condition allows us to >construct valid confidence intervals for the average treatment effect of each group. The use of the proposed methodology is illustrated through an empirical exercise >that revisits the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight* </sub>

## Work in Progress
<b>**Modified Ordered Random Forest.**</b>

><sub>*Empirical studies from various social sciences frequently deal with discrete outcomes that exhibit inherent ordering, such as self-evaluations of subjective >well-being and self-assessments in health domains. While ordered choice models are commonly used to analyze these outcomes, existing estimators make restrictive >parametric and distributional assumptions. This paper proposes a completely nonparametric estimator, the modified ordered random forest, which overcomes these >limitations. The estimator modifies a standard random forest splitting criterion to build a collection of forests, each estimating the conditional probability of a >single class. Under an honesty condition, the predicted probabilities are consistent and asymptotically normal, allowing for the construction of valid confidence >intervals. The weights induced by each forest are used to estimate the variance of the predictions and obtain estimation and inference about the covariates' marginal >effects. Evidence from synthetic and real data sets shows that the proposed estimator features a superior prediction performance than alternative estimators.*
