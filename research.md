> <sub> *Uncovering the heterogeneous effects of particular policies or "treatments" is a key concern for researchers and policymakers. A common approach is to report average treatment effects in different subgroups based on observable covariates. However, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty about the appropriate grouping. This paper proposes a nonparametric approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. The approach constructs a sequence of groupings, one for each level of granularity. Groupings are nested and feature an optimality property. An "honesty" condition allows us to construct valid confidence intervals for the average treatment effect of each group. The use of the proposed methodology is illustrated through an empirical exercise that revisits the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight.* </sub>

## Work in Progress
- <b>**Modified Ordered Random Forest.**</b>

><sub>*Empirical studies from various social sciences frequently deal with discrete outcomes that exhibit inherent ordering, such as self-evaluations of subjective well-being and self-assessments in health domains. While ordered choice models are commonly used to analyze these outcomes, existing estimators make restrictive parametric and distributional assumptions. This paper proposes a completely nonparametric estimator, the modified ordered random forest, which overcomes these limitations. The estimator modifies a standard random forest splitting criterion to build a collection of forests, each estimating the conditional probability of a single class. Under an honesty condition, the predicted probabilities are consistent and asymptotically normal, allowing for the construction of valid confidence intervals. The weights induced by each forest are used to estimate the variance of the predictions and obtain estimation and inference about the covariates' marginal effects. Evidence from synthetic and real data sets shows that the proposed estimator features a superior prediction performance than alternative estimators.*
