<p>Riccardo is a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Finance at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. He is an econometrician with a keen interest in adapting machine learning techniques for causal inference. He also focuses on applied microeconomics, particularly mental health issues and LGBTQ+ economics. When Riccardo is not busy crunching numbers and analyzing data, you might find him out for a hike, training in the boxing ring, or strumming away on his bass guitar. Looking to the future, Riccardo plans to pursue a Post-Doc position after completing his Ph.D.</p>
