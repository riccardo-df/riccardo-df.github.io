<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Finance at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.
My main research interests lie at the intersection of causal inference and statistical learning. 
I aim to contribute to the recent causal machine learning literature by developing new methodologies 
to estimate and describe treatment effect heterogeneity, thereby providing tools to deepen our understanding 
of how the policies' impact varies according to the units' observable characteristics.</p>
