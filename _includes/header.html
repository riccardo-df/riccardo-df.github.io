            Hello there!
            I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Finance at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. My specialization lies in econometrics with a strong inclination towards adapting machine learning techniques for 
            causal inference. I also focus on applied microeconomics, particularly mental health issues and LGBTQ+ economics.
            When I am not busy crunching numbers and analyzing data, you might find me hiking, training in the boxing ring, or strumming away on my bass guitar.
            As I look ahead, my aspiration is to secure a Post-Doc position upon the completion of my Ph.D. I believe this journey will enable me to further explore and contribute to the evolving landscape of economic 
            research.
        </p>
