            Hello there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Finance at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. My specialization lies in econometrics, with a strong inclination towards adapting machine learning techniques for 
            causal inference. I also focus on applied microeconomics, particularly mental health issues and LGBTQ+ economics. When I am not busy crunching numbers and analyzing data, you might find me hiking, training in the 
            boxing ring, or strumming away on my bass guitar.
        </p>
            
        <p align="justify">
            I will defend my Ph.D. thesis in September 2024 and will then join Southern Denmark University as a Post-Doc in October 2024.
        </p>
