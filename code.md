> <sub> *Nonparametric data-driven approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. Aggregation trees allow researchers to assess whether there is relevant heterogeneity in treatment effects. The approach generates a sequence of optimal groupings, one for each level of granularity. For each grouping, we obtain point estimation and inference about the Group Average Treatment Effects. Please reference the use as [Di Francesco (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304256).* <sub>
