## R Packages

evaluCATE: Evalutation of CATEs Estimates
[[*Website*]](https://riccardo-df.github.io/evaluCATE/)

ocf: Ordered Correlation Forest 
[[*Website*]](https://riccardo-df.github.io/ocf/)
[[*CRAN*]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ocf/index.html)
> <sub> Machine learning estimator specifically optimized for handling ordered non-numeric outcomes. OCF provides estimation and inference about the conditional choice probabilities and the covariatesâ€™ marginal effects. </sub>

aggTrees: Aggregation Trees 
[[*Website*]](https://riccardo-df.github.io/aggTrees/)
[[*CRAN*]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aggTrees/index.html)
> <sub> *Nonparametric data-driven approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. aggTrees allows researchers to assess whether there exists relevant heterogeneity in treatment effects by generating a sequence of optimal groupings, one for each level of granularity. For each grouping, we obtain point estimation and inference about the Group Average Treatment Effects. Please reference the use as [Di Francesco (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304256).* </sub>
